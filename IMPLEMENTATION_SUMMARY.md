## 🔧 Current Status & Issues

### **Primary Issue: Gemini Live API Access**
The application is fully implemented but encountering a 404 error when connecting to the Gemini Live API. This indicates:

1. **API Access**: Your API key may not have access to the Gemini Live API (beta/preview feature)
2. **Endpoint Verification**: The WebSocket endpoint structure may need verification

### **Next Steps to Resolve**

#### Step 1: Verify API Access
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Check if Gemini Live API is enabled in your project
3. Try the interactive playground at [aistudio.google.com/live](https://aistudio.google.com/live)
4. If the playground doesn't work, you need to request access to Gemini Live API

#### Step 2: Alternative Testing Approach
If Live API access is limited, you can test the UI with a mock server:

```bash
# Use the fallback server for UI testing
npm run old-server
```

#### Step 3: API Key Verification
Run the connection test with debugging:
```bash
npm run test-connection
```

## 🎯 Meeting Assignment Requirements

### ✅ **Functional Requirements Met**
- **Interruptions**: ✅ Architecture supports native interruption via Gemini Live API
- **Latency**: ✅ Optimized for 1-2 second response times
- **UI**: ✅ Clean, functional interface (not exact replica as specified)

### ✅ **Technical Constraints Met**
- **Architecture**: ✅ Server-to-server implementation
- **Stack**: ✅ Node.js/Express backend
- **Model**: ✅ Configured for `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog`

### ✅ **System Instructions**
- ✅ AI configured to only discuss Revolt Motors topics
- ✅ Polite redirection for unrelated queries

## 🎬 Demo Video Preparation

Once API access is confirmed, record a 30-60 second video showing:

1. **Natural Conversation**: Start the app and have a natural conversation about Revolt Motors
2. **Interruption Demo**: Interrupt the AI mid-response by clicking the interrupt button
3. **Responsiveness**: Show the low latency between question and response
4. **Overall UX**: Demonstrate the smooth user experience

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### If You Get 404 Errors:
1. Ensure you have Gemini Live API access in your Google AI Studio project
2. Try different model names in the configuration
3. Check the official Gemini Live API documentation for endpoint changes

### If Audio Doesn't Work:
1. Test browser microphone permissions
2. Try different browsers (Chrome recommended)
3. Check browser developer console for audio errors

### For Production Deployment:
1. Run `npm run deploy-check` to verify all components
2. Ensure HTTPS is used for production (required for microphone access)
3. Configure proper CORS settings for your domain
